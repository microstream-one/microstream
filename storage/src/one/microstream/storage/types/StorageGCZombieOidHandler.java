/**
 * Note on zombie OID / null entry during GC:
 * This should of course never happen and must be seen as a bug.
 * However the GC is not necessarily the place to break in such a case.
 * Currently, this can even happen regularly, if the last reference to an entity is removed, then the GC
 * deleted the entity and then a store reestablishes the reference to the then deleted entity.
 * This might be a bug in the user code or in the storer or object registry or whatever, but it should
 * be recognized and handled at that point, not break the GC.
 * For that reason, handling an encountered zombie OID is modularized with the default of ignoring it.
 *
 * Note that ConstantIds for JLS constants and TypeIds are intentionally unresolvable in the persistent state.
 * @see Persistence.IdType#TID
 * @see Persistence.IdType#CID
