	/* (20.09.2018 TM)TODO: BinaryValueSetter performance optimization
	 * A distinction betwee BinaryValueSetterPrimitive and BinaryValueSetterReference could be made.
	 * Since the persistent form order all references at the start and all primitives afterwards,
	 * the switching overhead from one array iteration to another would be minimal.
	 * As a result, setting a primitive value could omit the reference to the idResolver.
	 * However it is not clear how much performance that would effectively bring.
	 * 
	 * Before a premature optimization is done, this should be tested.
	 * However, if the order of all primitives in instance form and in persistent form is exactely the same,
	 * a shortcut for copying primitives could be made where a low-level loop (Unsafe) copies all primitive
	 * values at one swoop. Or at least all per inheritence level.
	 * However, all these assumptions about memory layout would have to be thoroughly validated at type handler
	 * initialization and if not true, a fallback to the current mechanism would have to be used.
	 * 
	 * In short: here should be a lot of performance optimization potential, but it has to be done properly.
