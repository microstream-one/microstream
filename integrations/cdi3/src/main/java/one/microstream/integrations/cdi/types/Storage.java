/**
 * The Storage class in MicroStream indicates a class as a root instance.
 * Object instances can be stored as simple records.
 * One value after another as a trivial byte stream.
 * References between objects are mapped with unique numbers, called ObjectId, or short OID. + With both combined,
 * byte streams and OIDs, an object graph can be stored in a simple and quick way,
 * as well as loaded, as a whole or partially.
 * Ref: <a href="https://docs.microstream.one/manual/storage/root-instances.html">Root instances</a>
 * <p>
 * Each application must have a unique class with this annotation.
 * Note: To increase performance use immutable sub-graphs as often as possible.
