public class Credentials

    /**
     * The type of the authentication mechanism. Supported values are:
     * <ul>
     * <li>"gssapi"</li>
     * Creates a MongoCredential instance for the GSSAPI SASL mechanism with the supplied "configuration.username" property. To override the default service name of "mongodb", add a mechanism property with the name "SERVICE_NAME". To force canonicalization of the host name prior to authentication, add a mechanism property with the name "CANONICALIZE_HOST_NAME" with the value true. To override the javax.security.auth.Subject with which the authentication executes, add a mechanism property with the name "JAVA_SUBJECT" with the value of a Subject instance. To override the properties of the javax.security.sasl.SaslClient with which the authentication executes, add a mechanism property with the name "JAVA_SASL_CLIENT_PROPERTIES" with the value of a Map<String, Object> instance containing the necessary properties. This can be useful if the application is customizing the default javax.security.sasl.SaslClientFactory.
     *
     * <li>"plain"</li>
     * Creates a MongoCredential instance for the PLAIN SASL mechanism. Credentials will be loaded from the credentials.username, credentials.source and credentials.password properties.
     *
     * <li>"mongodb-x509"</li>
     * Creates a MongoCredential instance for the MongoDB X.509 protocol with the supplied "configuration.username" property.
     *
     * <li>"mongo-cr"</li>
     * Creates a MongoCredential instance with an unspecified mechanism. The client will negotiate the best mechanism based on the version of the server that the client is authenticating to. Credentials will be loaded from the credentials.username and credentials.password properties.
     * </ul>
