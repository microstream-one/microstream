 * Marker type to indicate that a certain implementation is a composition (is composed of unshared objects).

 * from implementations that require (or at least suggest) tailored generic treatment, e.g. for a persistence layer
 * to persist the unshared objects in an inlined fashion rather than storing an external reference.
 * <p>
 * This is done via an interface instead of an annotations because the design aspect to be represented is a typical
 * "is-a" relation and because annotation should actually not alter programm behavior.
