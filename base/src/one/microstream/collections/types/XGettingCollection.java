	/**
	 * Performs an equality comparison according to the specification in {@link Collection}.
	 * <p>
	 * Note that it is this interface's author opinion that the whole concept of equals() in standard Java, especially
	 * in the collection implementations, is flawed.<br>
	 * The reason is because all different kinds of comparison types that actually depend on the situation
	 * have to be mixed up in a harcoded fashion in one method, from identity comparison over
	 * data indentity comparison to content comparison. <br>
	 * In order to get the right behavior in every situation, one has to distinct between different types of equality<br>
	 * <p>
	 * This means several things:<br>
	 * 1.) You can't just say for example an ArrayList is the "same" as a LinkedList just because they contain the
	 * same content.<br>
	 * There are different implementations for a good reason, so you have to distinct them when comparing.
	 * There are simple code examples which create massive misbehavior that will catastrophically ruin the runtime
	 * behavior of a programm due to this error in Java / JDK / Sun / whatever.<br>
	 * 2.) You can't always determine equality of two collections by determining equality of each element as
	 * {@link Collection} defines it.
	 * <p>
	 * As a conclusion: don't use this method!<br>
	 * Be clear what type of comparison you really need, then use one of the following methods
	 * and proper comparators:<br>
	 * {@link #equals(XGettingCollection, Equalator)}<br>
	 * {@link #equalsContent(XGettingCollection, Equalator)}<br>
	 * <p>
