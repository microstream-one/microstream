/**
 * Bag type collections make the single demand (thus being a level 1 collection type) that duplicate elements have
 * to be allowed, effectively being the opposite to set type collections.
 * <p>
 * The naming for the type is based on the conception that a bag can contain any elements (including duplicates),
 * but is definitely not ordered.
 * <p>
 * Apologies to the Apache guys (but honestly: why should the conception of a "bag" imply that its contained elements
 * are counted? Apart from that, counting elements is such a specific addon logic, that the proper approach would be
 * to extend an existing type, like CountingList, etc. but surely not "bag", which implies unordered content).
 * <p>
 * This will probably be a rather academic type and has been introduced more for reasons of completeness of the
 * typing architecture, as in practice, list type collections will be preferred to pure bag type collections.
 * <p>
 * Bag type collections are architectural on par with the other level 1 collection types set and sequence.
 * <p>
 * Currently, the only known to be useful subtype of a bag is the level 2 collection type list, combining bag
 * and sequence (order of elements).
