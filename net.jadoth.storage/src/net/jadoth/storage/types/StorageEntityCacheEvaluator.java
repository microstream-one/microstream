			/* simple default algorithm to take cache size, entity cached data length, age and reference into account:
			 *
			 * - subtract current cache size from threshold, resulting in an abstract value how "free" the cache is.
			 *   This also means that if the current cache size alone reaches the threshold, the entity will definitely
			 *   be cleared from the cache, no matter what (panic mode to avoid out of memory situations).
			 *
			 * - calculate "weight" of the entity and compare it to the memory's "freeness" to evaluate.
			 *
			 * "weight" calculation:
			 * - the entity's memory consumption (cached data length)
			 * - mutliplied by its "cache age" in ms, divided by 2^16 (roughly equals age in minutes)
			 *   the division is crucial to give newly loaded entities a kind of "grace time" in order to
			 *   not constantly unload and load entities in filled systems (avoid live lock)
			 * - multiply weight by 2 if entity has no references.
			 *   Non-reference entities tend to be huge (text, binaries) and won't be needed by GC, so they have
			 *   less priority to stay in cache or higher priority to be cleared before entities with references.
			 *
			 * In conclusion, this algorithm means:
			 * The more the cache approaches the threshold, the more likely it gets that entities will be
			 * cleared from the cache, especially large, old, non-reference entities.
			 * And the older (not recently used) entities become, the more likely it gets that they will be cleared,
			 * to a point where eventually every entity will be unloaded in a system without activity, resulting in
			 * dormant systems automatically having an empty cache.
			 *
			 * Example:
			 * Assume an "abstract" threshold value of 10 billion and a current cache size of 5 GB ("50% full")
			 * A binary array with a (huge) size of 1 GB will be unloaded after 3 minutes of not being used.
			 * 0th minute: 10bil - 5 bil = 5 bil > 1 bil * 0 * 2
			 * 1st minute: 10bil - 5 bil = 5 bil > 1 bil * 1 * 2
			 * 2nd minute: 10bil - 5 bil = 5 bil > 1 bil * 2 * 2
			 * 3rd minute: 10bil - 5 bil = 5 bil < 1 bil * 3 * 2 -> unload
			 * While smaller entities (typcially ~100 byte), especially ones with reference, can almost always stay
			 * in cache until the timeout hits or the cache gets critically full.
			 * (10bil - 5 bil = 5 bil < 100 * ~90_YEARS * 1)
			 * This is a quite reasonable approach given the rather fast execution time of the formula.
			 *
			 * Note that this method operates solely on this instance and the entity instance, no further pointer
			 * chasing (e.g. to the entity type) and therefore potential cache miss is needed.
