 * Marker type to indicate that all fields (the state) used in the implementation of {@link #equals(Object)}

 * and {@link #hashCode()} can never change during the life span of an instance of this type.
 * <p>
 * This additional contract is required to enable the proper use of {@link Object#equals(Object)} and
 * {@link Object#hashCode()}, because {@link Object#hashCode()}-depending hashing depends on this behavior
 * to remain consistent.
 * <p>
 * For any type not implementing this class (or not commonly known to be immutable, like {@link String},
 * {@link Integer}, etc.), do not rely on neither {@link Object#equals(Object)} nor {@link Object#hashCode()},
 * as implementations overriding them are potentially broken in terms of the required behavior (e.g. JDK
 * implementations of {@link Collection} are).<br>
 * For those cases, use an externally defined {@link Equalator} or {@link HashEqualator} with fitting implementation
 * instead.
