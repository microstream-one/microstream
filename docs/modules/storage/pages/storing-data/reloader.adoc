= Reloading

New functionality since MicroStream v8.0

When you have already changed your object within memory, but not yet stored through the `store()` method of the _StorageManager_, you can re-load the data from the storage using the `Reloader` class.

== Code

The `Reloader` class makes the functionality that was already available within the `PersistenceLoader` class easier accessible.

After you have created an instance of a `Reloader` instance, you can reload an object with the `reloadFlat()` method, or the entire object graph of this instance with the `reloadDeep()`.

The following snippet shows an example of reloading a _List_ where it restores the items as it is stored in the data storage.

[source, java]
----
    final Reloader reloader = Reloader.New(persistenceManager);
    reloader.reloadFlat(root.getData());
