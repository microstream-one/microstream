= Client GUI

Based on the REST API we provide a client, which serves a convenient web user interface to browse through the storage data.

It is a runnable jar which starts a simple web server which then can be accessed by a browser of your choice.

To download it use the following Maven command to download it into the current directory.

[source, shell, title="CLI"]
----
mvn dependency:get -Dartifact=one.microstream:microstream-storage-restclient-app:{maven-version}:jar -Dtransitive=false -Ddest=storage.restclient.app-{maven-version}.jar
----

or this direct link:

https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/one/microstream/microstream-storage-restclient-app/{maven-version}/microstream-storage-restclient-app-{maven-version}.jar

Start the client.
The port parameter is optional, default port is 8080.

[source, text, subs=attributes+]
----
java -jar microstream-storage-restclient-app-{maven-version}.jar --server.port=8888
----

Then just open http://localhost:8888 in your browser, select the base URL of the REST service and click connect.
