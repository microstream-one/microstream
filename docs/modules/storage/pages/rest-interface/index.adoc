= REST Interface

The MicroStream Storage isn't a typical database server with administrative tooling and stuff like that.
It is just a Java library which runs embedded in your application.
The storage data layer, per default the file system, contains the serialized and persisted data.
But it is not really accessible, or more precise, human-readable.
Nor do we provide a query language to access the storage data.

The Java objects, which reside in memory, are easy to inspect and traverse, e.g. with a debugger.

But for various purposes, like monitoring, the requirement to read the actual stored data has come up.

Since version 3.0 a REST interface for the storage data is included.
It enables you to access the data via REST calls or a convenient user interface.

It is made up of the following modules:
