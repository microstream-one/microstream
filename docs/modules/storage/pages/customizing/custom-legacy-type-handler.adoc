= Custom Legacy Type Handler

In addition to the methods for legacy type mapping described in chapter xref:legacy-type-mapping/index.adoc[Legacy Type Mapping] there is also the possibility to implement custom legacy type handlers.
Those handlers are the most flexible way to do the mapping from old to new types.

The basic interface that has to be implemented is `one.microstream.persistence.types.PersistenceLegacyTypeHandler.`

Fortunately the standard persistence implementation provides the abstract class `one.microstream.persistence.binary.types.BinaryLegacyTypeHandler.AbstractCustom` that should be sufficient to start with a custom implementation in most cases.

NOTE: See the example *customLegacyTypeHandler* on https://github.com/microstream-one/examples/tree/master/customLegacyTypeHandler[GitHub]

NOTE: Please note the this example requires manual code modifications as described in it's main class.
