|===
|Property   
|Description   
//-------------
|endpoint-override
|The endpoint with which the SDK should communicate.

|region
|Configure the region with which the SDK should communicate.
If this is not specified, the SDK will attempt to identify the endpoint automatically using the following logic:

. Check the 'aws.region' system property for the region. 
. Check the 'AWS_REGION' environment variable for the region. 
. Check the {user.home}/.aws/credentials and {user.home}/.aws/config files for the region. 
. If running in EC2, check the EC2 metadata service for the region.

|credentials.type
|The type of the credentials provider. Supported values are:

* "environment-variables"
Credentials will be loaded from the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY and AWS_SESSION_TOKEN environment variables.
* "system-properties"
Credentials will be loaded from the aws.accessKeyId, aws.secretAccessKey and aws.sessionToken system properties.
* "static"
Credentials will be loaded from the credentials.access-key-id and credentials.secret-access-key properties.
* "default"
Credentials provider chain that looks for credentials in this order: 
. Java System Properties - aws.accessKeyId and aws.secretKey 
. Environment Variables - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY 
. Credential profiles file at the default location (~/.aws/credentials) shared by all AWS SDKs and the AWS CLI 
. Credentials delivered through the Amazon EC2 container service if AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI" environment variable is set and security manager has permission to access the variable, 
. Instance profile credentials delivered through the Amazon EC2 metadata service

|credentials.access-key-id
|The access key id, used when "credentials.type" is "static".

|credentials.secret-access-key
|The secret access key, used when "credentials.type" is "static".
