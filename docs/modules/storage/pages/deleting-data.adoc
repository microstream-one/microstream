= Deleting Data

Deleting data does not require performing explicit deleting actions like `DELETE FROM table WHERE...`. Instead you just need to clear any references to the object in your object-graph and store those changes.
If a stored object is not reachable anymore its data will be deleted from the storage later.
This behavior is comparable to Java's garbage collector.

[source, java]
----
root.MyArrayList.remove(0);
storage.store(root.MyArrayList);
----

CAUTION: Deleted data is not erased immediately from the storage files.

The erasing from the storage files is done by the xref:housekeeping.adoc[housekeeping] process.
