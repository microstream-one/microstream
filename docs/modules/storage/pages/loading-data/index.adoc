= Loading Data

Loading data can be done in two ways, eager and Lazy.
The basic, default way of loading is eager loading.
This means that all objects of a stored object graph are loaded immediately.
This is done during startup of the MicroStream database instance automatically if an already existing database is found.

Contrary to xref:loading-data/lazy-loading/index.adoc[lazy loading], eager loading has no requirements to your entity model.

To load your data you just need to create an `EmbeddedStorageManager` instance:

[source, java]
----
EmbeddedStorageManager storage = EmbeddedStorage.start();
----

After that just get the root instance of your object graph from the `StorageManager` by calling `EmbeddedStorageManager.root()` and check for `null` as this indicates a non-existing database

[source, java]
----
final EmbeddedStorageManager storage = EmbeddedStorage.start();

if(storage.root() == null)
{
	//No existing Database found
}
else
{
	MyRoot root = (MyRoot) storage.root();
}
----
