|Supported 
|Note

|Classes
|image::symbol-check.svg[]
|

|Classes without default constructor
|image::symbol-check.svg[]
|

|Abstract classes / Interfaces
|image::symbol-check.svg[]
|Perfectly handleable as types, but there can never be instances to be persisted in the first place.

|Inner classes
|image::symbol-check.svg[]
|

|Anonymous inner classes
|image::symbol-check.svg[]
|

|Primitives
|image::symbol-check.svg[]
|

|References
|image::symbol-check.svg[]
|

|Final fields
|image::symbol-check.svg[]
|

|Static fields
|image::symbol-remove.svg[]
|Not supported since they are outside of an entity graph / a database, i.e. potentially shared by multiple graphs.

|Constant primitives
|image::symbol-remove.svg[]
|No sense in persisting those. These are just plain trivial values outside of an entity graph / a database.

|Constant instances
|image::symbol-check.svg[]
|Must be registered for loading to update them instead of creating independent new instances.

|Primitive arrays
|image::symbol-check.svg[]
|

|Object arrays
|image::symbol-check.svg[]
|

|Multi dimensional arrays
|image::symbol-check.svg[]
|Technically the same as object arrays as every array is an object itself.

|JDK value types (String, Number types, Date, File, Locale, Optional, ...)
|image::symbol-check.svg[]
|Optimized handling via custom TypeHandlers.

|Collections
|image::symbol-check.svg[]
|Via generic handling logic (List, Set, Map, etc.). Optimal handling required tailored TypeHandler (e.g. correctly handling loadFactor in java.util.HashMap)

|Nested Collections
|image::symbol-check.svg[]
|

|JVM system-tied classes (Thread, ClassLoader, WeakReference, ...)
|image::symbol-check.svg[]
|Technically handleable, but handling system-instances could cause fatal problems (e.g. start a Thread just from loading data), so it is intentionally disabled.

|JVM external-tied classes (IO-Streams, FileChannel, ...)
|image::symbol-check.svg[]
|Technically handleable, but external dependencies could cause fatal problems (e.g. existence of a referenced file), so it is intentionally disabled.

== Java 5

[options="header",cols="1,^1a,2a"]
|===
|Feature 
|Supported 
|Note

|Enums
|image::symbol-check.svg[]
|Automatically handled as constant instances to maintain referential integrity / identity.

|Enums with mutable state
|image::symbol-check.svg[]
|

|Enums anonymous subclasses
|image::symbol-check.svg[]
|

== Java 8

[options="header",cols="1,^1a,2a"]
|===
|Feature 
|Supported 
|Note

|Lambdas
|image::symbol-remove.svg[]
|Type-handleable in theory. But JVM is not able to resolve its own type definitions for lambdas.
|===

== Java 14

[options="header",cols="1,^1a,2a"]
|===
|Feature 
|Supported 
|Note

|Records
|image::symbol-check.svg[]
|Records are mere syntax sugar for classes, see xref:faq/java-features.adoc#records[FAQ].
|===

== Java 17

[options="header",cols="1,^1a,2a"]
|===
|Feature 
|Supported 
|Note

|Immutable Set
|image::symbol-check.svg[]
|Automatically handled until Java 14, for Java 15 and later use the microstream-persistence-binary-jdk17 module, see xref:addendum/specialized-type-handlers.adoc#JDK17[microstream-persistence-binary-jdk17]

|Immutable List
|image::symbol-check.svg[]
|Automatically handled until Java 14, for Java 15 and later use the microstream-persistence-binary-jdk17 module, see xref:addendum/specialized-type-handlers.adoc#JDK17[microstream-persistence-binary-jdk17]
