= Serializer

MicroStream's serialization engine, which is used by the storage and the cache, can be used standalone as well.
It is usable as a replacement for the default Java serialization to convert objects to a binary format and vice versa. This API is part of the persistence-binary module:

== Prerequisites

[source, xml, title="pom.xml", subs=attributes+]
----
<dependencies>
	<dependency>
		<groupId>one.microstream</groupId>
		<artifactId>microstream-persistence-binary</artifactId>
		<version>{maven-version}</version>
	</dependency>
</dependencies>
----

== Usage

You can use any medium type, but for most purposes the byte array version should be sufficient, to transfer the serialized form over the transport layer of your choice.
Simply create a serializer instance, optionally based on a foundation, and call the `serialize` and `deserialize` methods.

[source, java]
----
final SerializerFoundation<?> foundation = SerializerFoundation.New()
	.registerEntityTypes(Customer.class);
final Serializer<byte[]> serializer = Serializer.Bytes(foundation);
byte[] data = serializer.serialize(customer);
Customer restored = serializer.deserialize(data);
----

== Type handling
The serializer uses the MicroStream type handling system. This includes registration of new types on demand during serialization and xref:storage:legacy-type-mapping/index.adoc[legacy type mapping] when deserializing.
The `SerializerFoundation` provides an API like the MicroStream storage to configure the type handling behavior.

[IMPORTANT]
The default Serializer implementation does not include type information in the serialized output!
If you want to deserialize that with another serializer instance you must register all classes using the `SerializerFoundation` before you create the serializer or use a `TypedSerializer`!

== TypedSerializer
The `TypedSerializer` implementation includes type information into the serialized output.
By default the complete set of type information is included in all serialized output.

[source, java]
----
final Serializer<byte[]> serializer = TypedSerializer.Bytes(foundation);
byte[] data = serializer.serialize(customer);
Customer restored = serializer.deserialize(data);
----

=== Configuring the included type information
To reduce the serialized data it is possible to configure the included type information by suppling a `SerializerTypeInfoStrategyCreator` to the `SerializerFoundation`.
[source, java]
----
final SerializerFoundation<?> foundation = SerializerFoundation.New()
	.setSerializerTypeInfoStrategyCreator(
		new SerializerTypeInfoStrategyCreator.IncrementalDiff(false));
return TypedSerializer.Bytes(foundation);
----

==== Available options are:

[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|Property   
|Description
//-------------  
|TypeDictionary
|Includes type information for all types currently known to the serializer including those registered during the setup.
|Diff
|Includes type information for all types currently known to the serializer including those registered during the setup.
|IncrementalDiff
|Includes only type information for types added to the serializers type registry in the current serialization. Types that are registered during the serializers setup are never included.
|===

==== The `includeTypeInfoOnce` parameter:
All three serializer type handling strategies allow to specify that the type information gets included only once if it has not changed by setting the parameter `includeTypeInfoOnce = true`.
If so, the type information is only included if there where new types registered during the current serialization.
