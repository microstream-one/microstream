= Serializer

MicroStream's serialization engine, which is used by the storage and the cache, can be used standalone as well.
It is usable as as replacement for the default Java serialization to convert objects to a binary format and vice versa. This API is part of the persistence-binary module:

== Prerequisites

[source, xml, title="pom.xml", subs=attributes+]
----
<dependencies>
	<dependency>
		<groupId>one.microstream</groupId>
		<artifactId>microstream-persistence-binary</artifactId>
		<version>{maven-version}</version>
	</dependency>
</dependencies>

== Usage

You can use any medium type, but for most purposes the byte array version should be sufficient, to transfer the serialized form over the transport layer of your choice.
Simply create a serializer instance, optionally based on a foundation, and call the serialize and deserialize methods.

[source, java]
----
final SerializerFoundation<?> foundation = SerializerFoundation.New()
	.registerEntityTypes(Customer.class);
final Serializer<byte[]> serializer = Serializer.Bytes(foundation);
byte[] data = serializer.serialize(customer);
Customer restored = serializer.deserialize(data);
