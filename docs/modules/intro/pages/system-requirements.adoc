In theory MicroStream is compatible with all JDK distributions from Version 11 on.

== Supported Operating Systems

* Every desktop or server operating system which the supported JVMs are available for
* Android 8+

== Third Party Libraries

MicroStream's core itself doesn't have any dependencies to other libraries whatsoever.
So you don't have to worry about potential conflicts in your environment.
This was a matter of choice of ours to keep the life of the developers using MicroStream as simple as possible.
On the other hand feel free to include any dependencies you need, MicroStream will play along well, e.g.
a logging framework of your choice.
