== 5.0.2

Bugfix release.

=== *Bugfixes*

== 5.0.1

Bugfix release.

=== *Bugfixes*

* Fixed broken build for microstream-storage-restclient-app

== 5.0

This release introduces some breaking changes. To fully support the Java Module System (Jigsaw) and to meet Maven's naming standards, we had to rename some packages and our artifact's IDs.
But don't worry. Just change the dependency configuration and organize some imports, and you are good to go. Existing storages are not affected and are fully compatible with this version.
For detailed information, see the migration guide below.

=== *Features*

* General purpose configuration layer on which the storage and cache configuration are now based on, with following key features:
** Tree like structure to support sub-configurations
** Input from various sources (ini, xml, yaml, ...)
** Typed getters for properties
** Extendable: custom property parsers and configuration loaders
** Adaptable: easy adaption to other framework's configurations, like e.g. Spring Boot
* Storage configuration now supports different file systems for live storage and backup
* GraalVM support: MicroStream's optimized memory adapter is now used automatically when running on GraalVM
* Restructured MicroStream's module and package structure to fully support the Java Module System and adopt Maven naming standards, see Migration Guide

=== *Bugfixes*

* Fixed sporadic index out of bounds exception when storage and backup had different storage targets with a channel count greater than one

[#5_0_migration-guide]
=== *Migration guide*

In order to fully support the Java Module System and adopt Maven naming standards we had to introduce some changes:

 ** Hazelcast
 ** Kafka
 ** MongoDB
 ** Redis

[#4_1_migration-guide]
=== *Migration guide*

From 4.1 no actions are necessary, for older versions see xref:#4_0_migration-guide[below].

== 4.0

=== *Features*

* File System Abstraction to support a variety of xref:storage:storage-targets/index.adoc[storage targets].
* Exporter API for storage configuration.

=== *Bugfixes*

* Better error handling in housekeeping, to avoid storage channel thread interruptions.
* Fixed XML loading bug under Android.

[#4_0_migration-guide]
=== *Migration guide*

All configuration code, which includes file paths, may be rewritten to use the new Abstract File System. +
For example see xref:storage:configuration/storage-files-and-directories.adoc[Storage Files] or xref:storage:configuration/backup/continuous-backup.adoc[Backup].

== 3.0.1

Bugfix release for projects using an old non public version.

=== *Bugfixes*

* Fixed bug in type dictionary parser for old legacy type handlers

== 3.0

=== *Features*

* Added a convenience layer for defining xref:storage:customizing/custom-type-handler.adoc[custom type handlers]
* Fully automatic xref:storage:loading-data/lazy-loading/clearing-lazy-references.adoc#automatically[lazy reference managing] for clearing older `Lazy` references as free memory gets lower.
* Completed optimized persistence handling for xref:storage:addendum/specialized-type-handlers.adoc[remaining types in JDK] that are reasonable to appear in entity graphs.
E.g.
`Currency`, `Locale`, `URI`, `URL`, `Path`
* Compatibility with projects using java modules ("jigsaw")
* Added JavaDoc for common types like `StorageConnection`, `StorageManager`, `StorageController`, etc.
* Auto-recognition for CSV separator character in configuration files (e.g.
legacy type mapping)
* JSR-107 compatible xref:cache:index.adoc[JCache provider] with additional xref:cache:use-cases/hibernate-second-level-cache.adoc[Hibernate cache region factory]
* xref:storage:rest-interface/index.adoc[Storage REST Service and Client] are available to access the storage data via REST, a Java-Wrapper thereof and a Web-UI

=== *Bugfixes*

* Fixed a potential race condition during loading
* Fixed a potential race condition and robustness issue during storing
* `StorageConnectionFoundation` instance is now properly created on demand.
* Removed unnecessary memory consumption exponential to channel count.
* Improved exception messages on invalid configuration values (file sizes etc.)
* Workarounded a JDK bug regarding file locking when importing files (JDK exception says another process is locking the file which is outright wrong)
* Fixed type resolving problems when different ClassLoaders are involved.
* Fixed a bug that caused loading of zero-length arrays to throw an exception despite everything being fine.
* Various smaller bugfixes for unnecessary exceptions in special cases and state robustness after exceptions.

[#3_0_migration-guide]
=== *Migration guide*

From 2.2 no actions are necessary, for older versions see xref:#2_2_migration-guide[below].

== 2.2

=== Features

* Removed `SelfStoring` without replacement since it could not be used recursively and has no advantages over just creating a static storing utility method for a certain entity.
* Added state validation of value type objects (e.g.
String, Integer, BigDecimal, etc.) upon loading.
This is hardly relevant in practice, but not having it can lead to confusing hello-world-like test applications.
* `EmbeddedStorageManager` now implements `java.lang.AutoClosable`.
* Replaced all provisional ``RuntimeException``s with either `PersistenceException` or `StorageException`, depending on the architectural level the corresponding source code it located.
* The two technically different root handling concepts ("default" and "custom") have been consolidated in a way that they are the same thing on the API level and interchangeable, meaning no more confusion with those root exception messages.
* All entity fields of type `transient EmbeddedStorageManager` now get a reference to the used `EmbeddedStorageManager` instance set upon loading/updating.
* The interfaces around storage managing have been enhanced so that it is now equally valid to just write `StorageManager` instead of `EmbeddedStorageManager`.
(An `EmbeddedStorageManager` "is a" `StorageManager`)
* Slight technical consolidation of Lazy reference handling caused the type Lazy to be moved from the package `one.microstream.persistence.lazy` to `one.microstream.reference`.
The reason is that the lazy handling has actually no inherent connection to persistence or storage.
It's actually just a generic concept that can be used by those layers.
See xref:#2_2_migration-guide[Migration Guide] below on how to adjust existing projects.

=== Bugfixes

* Fixed an off-heap memory leak when restarting the storage multiple times in the same process.
* Fixed a bug where changing the fields of an entity type caused an exception.
This was a regression bug from fixing a similar problem for another case in version 2.1.
Now, both cases work correctly.

[#2_2_migration-guide]
=== Migration Guide

All occurrences in user code of `one.microstream.persistence.lazy.Lazy` have to be refactored to `one.microstream.reference.Lazy`.
Modern IDEs provide a functionality to "auto-import" missing types or automatically "organize imports", so this should be resolved with a proverbial push of a button.

== 2.1

=== Features

* Android support MicroStream is now Java-wise fully compatible with Android.
* Replaced all usages of `java.util.File` with `java.nio.file.Path` to allow using custom file implementations.
* Improved skipping functionality of Storers (see `EmbeddedStorageManager#createStorer` and `Storer#skip`).
* The class Lazy is now an interface to allow custom implementations.
See Migration guide below.

=== Bugfixes

* Fixed a few minor bugs in the skipping functionality of Storers.
* Fixed a bug where files remained locked after the storage was shut down.
* Fixed a bug where files remained locked after an exception in storage initialization.
* Enums defining an abstract method are now handled correctly.
* By default, all threads created by MicroStream now start with the prefix "MicroStream-".
This can be customized by the new interface `StorageThreadNameProvider`.
* Fixed a NullPointerException in import.
* Fixed a bug that caused enums with a certain field layout to be loaded inconsistently.
* `java.util.Locale` is now persisted and created using Locale's `#toLanguageTag` and `#forLanguageTag`.

=== Migration Guide

In the directory of an existing storage, in the TypeDictionary file (default name "PersistenceTypeDictionary.ptd"), all occurrences of "one.microstream.persistence.lazy.Lazy" must be replaced with "one.microstream.persistence.lazy.Lazy$Default".
