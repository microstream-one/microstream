= Local File System

The NIO connector can access the local or mounted file systems, as well as different in-memory file systems. +
This is probably the easiest way to start, especially for prototyping and testing purposes. +
For productive use, the other file systems are preferred.

NioFileSystem fileSystem = NioFileSystem.New();

== Configuration

The local file system is the default setting.
If you want to use xref:configuration/index.adoc#external-configuration[external configuration], no further action is required.
