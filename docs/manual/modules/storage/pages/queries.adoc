= Queries

The MicroStream engine takes care of persisting your object graph.
When you do queries, they are not run on the data stored by MicroStream, queries run on your data in the local system memory.
There is no need to use special query languages like SQL.
All operations can be done with plain Java.
MicroStream does not restrict you in the way you query your object graph.
You are totally free to choose the best method fitting to your application.

One possibility may be Streams if you use the standard Java collections.

public List<Article> getUnAvailableArticles()
{
	return shop.getArticles().stream()
		.filter(a -> !a.available())
		.collect(Collectors.toList())

NOTE: Of course you must care about xref:loading-data/lazy-loading/index.adoc[lazy loading] if you use that feature.
